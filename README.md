Animal Chess Game is a simple game created and developed for a high school final project. It was build entirely on Python Turtle graphics, which is a drawing tool provided by Python. This project has 2 contributors: Brownie Tran (https://github.com/BrownieTr) and Trixie Vo (Github unknown). Although we've stopped develop this game, it still an incompleted project because we don't have time to fix some small bugs that can occur while playing the game. But you can still play and finish the game. (Note: We didn't think of deploying the game at the time so if you want to play the game, you might need to have a Python compiler download in your computer. Sorry for the inconvenient and have fun!)
